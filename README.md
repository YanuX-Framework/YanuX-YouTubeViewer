# YanuX YouTubeViewer
This is part of the [__YanuX Frameworl__](https://yanux-framework.github.io/). It is an application prototype which uses the automatic distribution of UI components based on the capabilities of the devices to provide a multi-device YouTube player experience.

It authenticates with the [__YanuX Auth__](https://yanux-framework.github.io/) and connects to the [__YanuX Broker__](https://github.com/YanuX-Framework/YanuX-Broker) using the [__YanuX Coordinator__](https://github.com/YanuX-Framework/YanuX-Coordinator).
